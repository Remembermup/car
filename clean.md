The correlation coefficient, often denoted as "r," is a statistical measure that quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges between -1 and +1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, and 0 indicates no linear correlation.

To calculate the correlation coefficient, you can use the following formula:

r = (Σ[(Xi - X̄)(Yi - Ȳ)]) / sqrt([Σ(Xi - X̄)²] * [Σ(Yi - Ȳ)²])

Here's a breakdown of the variables used in the formula:

Xi and Yi: The individual values of the two variables being analyzed.
X̄ and Ȳ: The means (averages) of the Xi and Yi values, respectively.
Σ: The sum of the values over the given range of data.
To calculate the correlation coefficient, follow these steps:

Compute the mean (average) of the Xi values and denote it as X̄.
Compute the mean (average) of the Yi values and denote it as Ȳ.
For each data point, subtract the mean of the X values (X̄) from the corresponding Xi value, and subtract the mean of the Y values (Ȳ) from the corresponding Yi value.
Square each of these differences (Xi - X̄) and (Yi - Ȳ).
